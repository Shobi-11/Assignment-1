OBJECT AND ITS INTERNAL REPRESENTATION:-

  * Objects, in JavaScript, are the most important data type and form the building blocks for modern JavaScript. 
These objects are quite different from JavaScriptâ€™s primitive data types (Number, String, Boolean, null, undefined,
 and symbol) in the sense that these primitive data types all store a single value each (depending on their types).
  * Object()  can be called with or without new. Both create a new object.

Syntax:

new Object(value)

Object(value)

let object_name = {
    key_name : value,
    ...
}

JavaScript Object Properties: A JavaScript property is a member of an object that associates a key with a value.

Instance Properties: An instance property is a property that has a new copy for every new instance of the class.

JavaScript Object Methods: JavaScript methods are actions that can be performed on objects. 

Static Methods: If the method is called using the Object class itself then it is called a static method of Object.
