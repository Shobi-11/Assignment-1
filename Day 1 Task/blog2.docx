OBJECT AND ITS INTERNAL REPRESENTATION:-

  * Objects, in JavaScript, are the most important data type and form the building blocks for modern JavaScript. 
These objects are quite different from JavaScript’s primitive data types (Number, String, Boolean, null, undefined,
 and symbol) in the sense that these primitive data types all store a single value each (depending on their types).
  * Object()  can be called with or without new. Both create a new object.

Syntax:

new Object(value)

Object(value)

let object_name = {
    key_name : value,
    ...
}

JavaScript Object Properties: A JavaScript property is a member of an object that associates a key with a value.

Instance Properties: An instance property is a property that has a new copy for every new instance of the class.

JavaScript Object Methods: JavaScript methods are actions that can be performed on objects. 

Static Methods: If the method is called using the Object class itself then it is called a static method of Object.
